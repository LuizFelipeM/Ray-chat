# Ray-chat

This project was developed to learning good practices and techniques commonly used in the software development work.
Initially will find a simple REST API developed with Node.JS with Postgres DB, a front-end web application developed with React.JS (futurely will be developed one with React Native as well), but in the futere the project will be converted to a microservice architecture implementing GraphQL, MongoDB and Postgres, Redis and maybe RabbitMQ.
